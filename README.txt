DRB1802 Section A

A few disclaimers regarding the program:
1) The program was entirely written from scratch, which may result in undiscovered bugs and inefficient code as we tried to focus more in the implementation of the algorithms. We apologize in advance for that.
2) The program is a bit slow, especially for a lower split value count. Please do not close the window if the program seems laggy, we assure you that it will eventually display the results.
3) Although the program was mainly made for the 2011 annual traffic accident data, it would work for any other dataset.
